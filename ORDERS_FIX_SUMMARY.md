# Orders System Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Supabase Permission Error (`permission denied for schema public`)

**Problem**: The orders table lacked proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies, causing permission errors when fetching orders.

**Solution**: Created `setup-orders-policies.sql` with comprehensive RLS policies:
- Enables RLS on `orders` and `order_items` tables
- Allows users to view orders where they are customer or seller
- Allows customers to create orders
- Allows sellers to update order status
- Grants appropriate permissions to authenticated users

**Action Required**: Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```bash
# Execute this file in Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor
cat setup-orders-policies.sql
```

### 2. ✅ Orders Not Showing After Completion

**Problem**: Orders page had proper real-time subscription and refresh logic, but was being blocked by the RLS permission error.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the underlying permission issue (above)
- The orders page already has:
  - Real-time subscriptions for new orders
  - Automatic refresh on successful checkout
  - Manual refresh button
  - API client integration

### 3. ✅ Order Status Handling

**Problem**: Order status updates were handled by the frontend but could fail due to permission issues.

**Solution**:
- Verified the `/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` PUT endpoint exists and works correctly
- Fixed RLS policies to allow sellers to update order status
- Orders page already has comprehensive status management:
  - Status update buttons for sellers
  - Status timeline visualization
  - Color-coded status badges
  - Role-based action buttons

### 4. ✅ Google Maps to Leaflet Migration

**Problem**: Application used Google Maps which requires API keys and has usage limits.

**Solution**:
- Installed Leaflet and React Leaflet packages
- Created new `LeafletLocationTracker` component with:
  - OpenStreetMap tiles (free, no API key needed)
  - Custom markers for pickup, delivery, and driver locations
  - Route visualization
  - Popup information windows
  - Responsive design
- Updated order tracking page to use Leaflet instead of Google Maps

## Current Status

All major issues have been addressed:

1. **Database Access**: RLS policies created (needs to be executed)
2. **Orders Display**: Fixed with permission resolution
3. **Status Management**: Already working, enhanced with proper permissions
4. **Maps**: Successfully migrated to Leaflet (no API key needed)

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Execute the RLS policies**:
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- File: setup-orders-policies.sql
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   - Place a test order
   - Check if orders appear in the orders page
   - Test order status updates as a seller
   - Verify order tracking with maps

### Optional Improvements:

1. **Remove Google Maps dependencies** (if no longer needed):
   ```bash
   npm uninstall @googlemaps/js-api-loader @googlemaps/react-wrapper
   ```

2. **Clean up old Google Maps component**:
   - Remove or rename `src/components/maps/LocationTracker.tsx`
   - Update any other components using Google Maps

## File Changes Made

- ✅ Created: `setup-orders-policies.sql` - Database RLS policies
- ✅ Created: `src/components/maps/LeafletLocationTracker.tsx` - New map component
- ✅ Modified: `src/app/dashboard/orders/[id]/track/page.tsx` - Updated to use Leaflet
- ✅ Modified: `package.json` - Added Leaflet dependencies

## Verification Steps

1. **Check database permissions**:
   - Execute the SQL policies
   - Try fetching orders through the API

2. **Test orders flow**:
   - Place an order (should appear immediately)
   - Check real-time updates
   - Test status changes

3. **Verify maps**:
   - Open order tracking page
   - Confirm Leaflet maps load without API key errors
   - Test marker functionality

## Error Resolution

The main error you were seeing:
```
Supabase error fetching orders: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'permission denied for schema public'
}
```

This will be resolved once you execute the RLS policies SQL script. The orders should then appear correctly in the orders page.
